# Foraging-variability
**=====================**

This folder contains the scripts to run analysis for 'Random exploration drives variability in patch foraging decisions across species' [add link]. 

**Datasets:**
* Le Heron et al (2020): field-human data
* Contreras-Huerta et al (2022): berry-human data
* Kane et al (2019): rat data

The folders contain:

* **data:** all data required to run the models and generate the figures from the paper 
* **figs:** all scripts to generate the figures and run relevant statistics 
* **models:** all scripts to calculate expected leaving times and variability, and model fitting and simulation scripts
* **stats:** R script to run linear mixed effects models (Figure 1 and 5) and JASP html output when calculating Bayes factors for paired comparisons

Model code and figure generation is in MATLAB (2023b). Linear mixed models are in R (session info available in stats folder). Bayes factors for paired comparisons are in JASP.
